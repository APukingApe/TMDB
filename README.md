# <p align="center">TMDb iOS Application</p>

This is the demo project of the article written in [my blog](https://onswiftwings.com/posts/mvvm-with-combine/). The application works as a mobile client for [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org). It follows MVVM software design pattern and is built with [Combine framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/).
